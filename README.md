# Diaryx Specification Readme

Here is the repository for the Diaryx Specification README! If you want to read the specification, [click here](<Diaryx Writing Specification>).

The Diaryx Specification is a standardized YAML schema and file organization format originally designed for my project [Diaryx](https://www.diaryx.net), to make it easier to share, import, and export personal writings. But I found it useful beyond the Diaryx application, so I decided to standardize it.

Right now, the Diaryx specification is probably most useful for power users of the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) app. (Click [here](<Diaryx-Obsidian Workflow>) to see how!) But eventually it will be the universal format for all personal writing, and perhaps even more forms of self-quantifying.

A website will soon be hosted at spec.diaryx.net showing the specification with nice examples!
