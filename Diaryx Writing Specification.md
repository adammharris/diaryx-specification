# Diaryx Writing Specification

The Diaryx Writing Format is a specific way of writing a digital document that makes the writing process easier and more effective. It is meant to be both human-readable and machine-parseable.

The purpose of writing is to connect the reader with the author. The Diaryx Writing Format is unique in that it places this purpose front and center. Each Diaryx document requires the author to specify the following properties:

1. `title`: a short summary of the document
2. `author`: the identity of the writer(s) of the document
3. `created`: the time the document was first created
4. `updated`: the time the document was last updated
5. `visibility`: the identity of the audience/reader(s) of the document
6. `format`: the format of the text body (for example, CommonMark)
7. `reachable`: where this writing is accessible

Requiring explicit definitions for these values makes writing easier and more productive for the author:

- Authors plan their writing more effectively when they are required to specify what they are writing about (title) and who they are writing to (visibility).
- Authors find it easier to write when they constantly have the purpose of their writing in view— less writer's block and more writing.
- Authors and coauthors find it easier to review writing when they can quickly grasp the context of the writing, without trying to search for it in the body of the text.

It also makes writing easier to understand and more impactful for the reader:

- Readers find it easier to know whether to read or not when the purpose and context of the writing is immediately clear.
- Readers find it easier to understand the writing as they read because the purpose of the writing is constantly visible.
- Readers find it easier to revisit and share the content afterward, because it is very clear what the content is and where and to whom it is accessible.

The way Diaryx accomplishes this is simple and compatible with widely-accepted standards: a Diaryx file is simply a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Markdown is a widely used markup format, and YAML frontmatter is a common standard for Markdown files, widely recognized in tools such as Pandoc and GitHub. So, the Diaryx Writing Format is perhaps best understood as a YAML frontmatter schema and a collection of best practices.

As an initial example, notice that this specification is written in Diaryx Format.

## 0.1 Why is this standard needed?

1. **Digital writing has no single portable format.** Note-taking apps in particular are notorious for locking users into their ecosystem. Even when a popular format such as Markdown is used, there’s no agreement on how to represent important metadata such as dates, relation to other writings, or sharing permissions. As a result, personal writings — often a person’s most important and private records — risk being lost over time.
2. **Most things people write are not intended to be public.** In contrast, existing standardized writing formats are public-facing (essays, posts, microblogs, comments). HTML, APA, and MLA are all designed for public-facing or academic work. Non-public or private writing deserves the same long-term portability as published works.
3. **Recent technological advances are forcing the world to reconsider what makes writing meaningful.** Most famously, applications for interfacing with large language models, such as ChatGPT, have shocked many people into wondering if essays are a dying art. The Diaryx Writing Format brings focus back on the timeless, core meaning of writing: the connection between reader and author.

The Diaryx Writing Format aims to fill these gaps by **standardizing good, readable metadata practices.** This helps Diaryx files be super portable and shareable, helps writers keep in mind why they are writing, and helps readers make more informed decisions about what they read.

## 0.2 Principles

Principles are guidelines for how this specification should be. Here are some guidelines:
- **Human-readable**: Diaryx metadata should make intuitive sense to a non-technical person reading the plain text file. For example, we avoid JSON and prefer YAML. And by default, a file's format is CommonMark, a well-defined markup syntax designed to be both readable in plain text and publishable as-is.
- **Self-describing**:  A Diaryx file should describe itself sufficiently well to introduce a newcomer. For example, the required properties answer the basic newcomer questions of "What is this?" (title) "Who wrote it?" (author) "When was it written?" (created, updated) "Who can see it?" (visibility) and "How do I understand it?" (format). Additional optional properties allow authors to provide more context when needed.
- **Author flexibility**: Should limit the author as little as possible— not requiring them to name or organize their files in a specific way where reasonable.
- **Minimal metadata**: A Diaryx file should describe itself as concisely as possible. It should follow well-established conventions and use the absolute minimum amount of metadata possible, while still being sufficiently self-describing.

## 0.3 YAML Frontmatter

A Diaryx file is typically a markdown file with a `.md` extension. In this file, there is a special section called "frontmatter." It is started and ended by triple dashes (`---`). Within the triple dash area is structured data written according to [YAML format](https://yaml.org). YAML is a simple way to write structured data.

## 0.4 Example

Imagine you open a file or folder without any prior context. What would you search for? How would you understand the content of the file?

Perhaps the most intuitive introduction is a plain description in your native language, like "This file is a journal entry recorded on Dec 31, 2003 by John Doe." However, this presupposes several things:
- the reader is familiar with how this entry relates to other entries
- the reader knows what format John Doe usually writes his entries in
- the reader knows John Doe is okay with sharing this entry

If the file was in Diaryx format, the reader would see something like this:

```yaml
---
title: Thoughts about stuff
author: John Doe
created: 2025-08-25 16:24:16-0600
updated: 2025-08-25 16:24:16-0600
visibility: family
format: "[CommonMark (Markdown)](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/)"
reachable: johndoe@email.com
part_of: "[](<Journal entries.md>)"
---
Today I had thoughts about stuff…
```

Now the reader knows that this entry is appropriate to share with family, and that John Doe recorded this particular entry in CommonMark format. We also see that this entry is part of a larger group of entries, as is evident in the `part_of` attribute.

## 0.5 Character Encoding and Line Endings

The Diaryx Writing Format uses UTF-8 character encoding and prefers LF (`\n`) line endings.

# 1.0 Required Properties

In Diaryx, some properties are required and some are optional. This section discusses the required properties.

## 1.1 `title`

This is a short string representing the document. Can include special characters as long as you wrap it in quotes or backslash-escape them.

```yaml
title: This is a title
title: "This { is:a } [ title:with ] <special:characters>"
```

## 1.2 `author`

Single string or list of strings representing author/authors of document. 

```yaml
# single author
author: A Single Author

# multiple authors
author:
- Author 1
- Author 2
- Author 3

# also supported:
author:
- A single author
```

## 1.3 `created`,  `updated`

RFC 3339 formatted timestamps representing the creation time and update time of the file.

### 1.3.1 A quick overview of the timestamp format

`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss-ZZ:zz`
1. four digit year (0000-9999)
2. dash '-'
3. two digit month (01-12)
4. dash '-'
5. two digit day (01-31)
6. letter 'T'
7. two-digit 24-hour time (00-23)
8. colon ':'
9. two-digit minute (00-59)
10. colon ':'
11. two-digit second (00-59)
12. plus or minus sign ('+' or '-')
13. two-digit hour timezone difference from UTC
14. colon ':'
15. two-digit minute timezone difference from UTC

This is not a comprehensive review of the RFC-3339 timestamp spec, but rather a quick guide for reference.

## 1.4 `visibility`

Intended to represent who the writing is intended for. Usually a list of values, but can rarely be a single value. Each of the strings can be anything, but there are a few values reserved words with special functionalities.

### 1.4.1 `public`

**Function**
Used to indicate that the author doesn't mind allowing unrestricted access to anyone who happens to find the document.

**Explanation** 
It can be useful if the author wants to write something quickly to publish on the Internet. However, using `public` as the *only* value for `visibility` is **strongly discouraged**. Applications implementing this specification should show a warning if that is the case. This is to encourage authors to consider their audience. Authors can use values such as `historians`, `[insert demographic group here]`, or whatever other value may clarify the reason why the document is public.

### 1.4.2 `universal`

**Function**
Same as `public`

**Explanation** 
Applies to documents of generally-agreed-upon moral or religious significance, such as the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), the Bible, and other documents of truly far-reaching influence, usually ones that have been translated into many languages. Unlike `public`, it is permissible to use this as the *only* value for `visibility`. Using this value means that the author truly intends the document to reach every single person ever. It is an opt-in measure so the author can say, "Yes, I truly intend to reach everyone. Don't make me specify more values because I have already truly considered my audience."

### 1.4.3 `private`

**Function**
Used to indicate that access is strictly limited to those named as author(s).

**Explanation**
It can be useful to make sure that the document is not accidentally published. However, using `private` as the *only* value for `visibility` is **strongly discouraged**. Applications implementing this specification should show a warning if that is the case.  This is to encourage authors to consider the reason why the document is private. Authors may use values such as `externalization`, `catharsis`, `rant`, `scratchpaper`, or others to indicate the reason why the document is private.

### 1.4.4 `disposable`

**Function**
Used to indicate that the document is ephemeral and is intended to be deleted without negative consequences.

**Explanation**
Useful for very sensitive information, or for AA-style write-then-burn cathartic  writing. Obviously be very careful with this value.

## 1.5 `format`

Markdown link pointing to the specification that defines how to parse this document's content. Can also be a list to allow for a certain format with extensions (for example, CommonMark with table, footnote, and callout extensions).

```yaml
format: "[CommonMark (Markdown)](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/)"
# alternatively…
format: "[](./style-guide.md)" # custom
format:
- "[CommonMark (Markdown)](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/)"
- "[](./custom-extension.md)"
format: "[GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)"
```

## 1.6 `reachable`

The purpose of this property is to show where this document is accessible, so it can be easily shared.

For public documents, this can be a URL or PID— some kind of clickable link that takes you to the document. The purpose of this property is to give a reader a way to share the document without copying and sending the entire document. So it should either be a reliable reference, or if the document is not public, perhaps contact information for the author of the document.

```yaml
reachable: https://www.example.com
# or, perhaps for a non-public document…
reachable: johndoe@email.com
```

For private documents, this can be a file path, a cloud/backup service, or similar. Values like `none` are discouraged because of the possibility that even private writing may be shared in the future, or the possibility that an author might lose a note and recover it after a long time. It is nevertheless left to the author's discretion.

# 2.0 Optional Properties

## 2.1 `contents`

Specifies child documents that this file organizes.

```yaml
contents:
  - "[Chapter One](chapter-01.md)"
  - "[Chapter Two](chapter-02.md)"
```

**Format rules:**

- Files are represented as quoted Markdown links: `"[alias](link)"`
- Items should be listed in intended reading/processing order
- File paths are relative to the document containing this frontmatter
- Note that markdown links must be URL-encoded. To avoid this, the CommonMark spec allows links to be wrapped in angle brackets so you can write the name of the link without URL encoding (for example, `[GoCoEdit Files](<GoCoEdit Files.md>)` as opposed to `[GoCoEdit Files](GoCoEdit%20Files.md)`)
- Make sure to include file extensions in the link for compatibility.
- Each referenced file should include a `part_of` property that links to this document.

## 2.2 `part_of`

Specifies parent index files that contain/organize this document.

```yaml
# Single parent
part_of: "[](<GoCoEdit files.md>)"

# Multiple parents
part_of:
  - "[](<GoCoEdit files.md>)"
  - "[](<Creative Writing.md>)"
```

**Format rules:**

- Similar to format rules for `contents`
- Each referenced file should include a `contents` property that links to this document.

## 2.3 `version`

A version number for the document, in case you want to record formal version updates. This specification has an example at the top.

## 2.4 `copying`

Used for showing users the ways they are allowed to copy the document. Can be a file path to a license file, or a link to a popular license, such as <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>. This specification has an example at the top.

## 2.5 `checksums`

File path to checksums. Useful for verifying file downloads.

## 2.6 `banner`

Used for specifying an optional Notion-style image banner over a file. Link to image, or alternatively use `!(alias)[<link>]` syntax.

## 2.7 `language`

Used for specifying the language this file is written in.

## 2.8 `tags`, `aliases`

Both of these are lists of arbitrary strings. `tags` is used for assigning topics or organization groups to entries. `aliases` is used to specify other names this entry could go by.

```yaml
tags: ["notes","thoughts"] #any string you want, as many as you want
aliases: ["That one note", "my favorite note"]
```

## 2.9 `this_file_is_root_index`

Flag indicating whether this file serves as the root index for a collection. If a file uses this property, it must also use the `contents` property. If present, must be `true`.
```yaml
this_file_is_root_index: true   # This is the main organizational hub
```

## 2.10 `starred`

Flag indicating that this file has been designated by the author to be part of a special first-class group of documents. If present, must be `true`.

## 2.11 `pinned`

Flag indicating that this file has been designated as requiring a prominent, visible spot in the UI.

# 3.0 Additional Optional Properties

For additional optional properties, see the following:
- Appendix A — Optional Properties — Health
- Appendix B — Optional Properties — Location
- Appendix C — Optional Properties — Weather
- Appendix D — Optional Properties — Device Information

# 4.0 Error Handling

If the YAML frontmatter is malformed, it may not be parsed and the Diaryx-formatted file is invalid.

If any of the required properties are missing pr invalid, the whole Diaryx file is invalid.

If the YAML is valid and required properties are present and valid, but some optional properties do not adhere to rules in the specification (for example, an invalid range or unit), that specific property is invalid, but the Diaryx formatted file is otherwise valid.

# 5.0 Contribution and Extensibility

The Diaryx Writing Specification is currently hosted on GitHub. To propose a change, please submit an issue or a pull request. Generally, it is recommended to submit an issue before submitting a pull request, so discussions can be made before proposing changes.

The Diaryx Writing Specification does not expressly prohibit additional YAML properties not in the specification, so it should be compatible with existing, more specific needs. If you have a workflow or use-case that you feel other authors would benefit from, please submit an issue or contact me at adam@diaryx.net.

```

## A.8 `sleep_scale`

Rate the quality of your sleep from 1 to 10. Same rules as `mood_scale`

## A.9 `blood_pressure`

blood_pressure: "120-80" #invalid, must be a /
```

## A.10 `heart_rate`

Record heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). Integer.

```yaml
water_consumed: "8 glasses" #good job!
water_consumed: "1liter" #thirsty! Space optional, `liter` is valid when the number is 1
```


# Appendix B — Optional Properties — Location

For those who use journaling to log their travels, Diaryx has optional support for location data, including `coordinates`, `location`, and `position`. 

## B.1 `coordinates`

This property is a comma-separated pair of floating point decimals, representing geographic coordinates. Degree sign (º) and letter indicators (N/S, E/W) are optional. Assumes the global WGS 84 datum.

```yaml
coordinates: "43.72309° N, 10.39657° E" # Leaning tower of Pisa!
coordinates: "-33.85684, 151.21510" # Sydney opera house!
# North/east = positive, south/west = negative
```

## B.2 `location`

This property is a string of text representing an address. Due to the widely varying nature of mailing/residental addresses, there is no standardized format for this property. A good rule of thumb is that a person should be able to copy/paste this value into a digital map and be able to find the location you are referring to.

```yaml
location: "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA  95014, United States"
location: "Great Pyramid of Giza, Giza, Egypt"
location: "40 Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul 04528, South Korea"
```

## B.3 `position`

This property is meant to include more specific information about location, such as a room in a house, a position on a chair, or a floor in a building.

```yaml
position: "bedroom"
position: "sitting on chair"
position: "3rd floor"
```


# Appendix C — Optional Properties — Weather

For those who log the weather in their journal, Diaryx has optional support for weather metadata. For now, this is supported in only one property.

## C.1 `weather`

This property is an enumerated value from a list taken from Open Weather Map. The value in the `weather` property may be any of the following, or up to four separate values containing no more than one value from each section:

### C.1.1 Thunderstorms

```
thunderstorm with light rain
thunderstorm with rain
thunderstorm with heavy rain

```

### C.1.5 Example

```yaml
weather: "thunderstorm" # it was a dark and stormy night…
weather: 
- "thunderstorm" # Or perhaps it was stormy…
- "snow" # AND snowy…
- "smoke" # And smokey?
- "scattered clouds: 25-50%" # And only half-covered?
```

**What about more weather information?**

Values such as sunset/sunrise times, moon phase, and length of day can be calculated from the location and time of your entry.

# Appendix D — Optional Properties — Device Information

For those who want to track which files were created on which device, Diaryx has optional support for device information properties. These properties have a soft-standardization: specific strings in them will be recognized, but there is no specific schema for them.

## D.1 `created_on_hardware`

This property is used to specify what kind of hardware this file was created on. For detailed information, you may use key-values separated by semicolons. You may also include a list of options to indicate that this entry was created through multiple devices.
```yaml
# general devices
created_on_hardware: "phone"
created_on_hardware: "laptop"
created_on_hardware: "desktop"
created_on_hardware: "tablet"
created_on_hardware: "e-reader"
created_on_hardware: "watch"
created_on_hardware: "other" # not recommended. Prefer leaving the property out entirely

# specific devices
created_on_hardware: "Adam's Laptop; Model Identifier: Mac15,6" # supported; "laptop" will be identified

created_on_hardware: # multiple entries supported
- "Adam's Laptop"
- "Adam's Phone"
- "Adam's Tablet"
```

## D.2 `created_on_software`

This property is used to specify which software this file was created with.

```yaml
created_on_software: "[Diaryx](https://www.diaryx.net)"
created_on_software: # mutliple entries supported
- "Diaryx"
- "Neovim"
- "Obsidian"
```
